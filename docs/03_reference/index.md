# Reference

This reference provides a comprehensive resource for effectively using and configuring the `robotcode` tool in Robot Framework projects. It covers two main areas:

- [**Command Line Interface (CLI)**](cli.md): Detailed guidance on using the `robotcode` CLI to manage tasks such as test execution, code analysis, debugging, and configuration management directly from the command line. Each CLI command is explained with descriptions, options, and examples to illustrate different use casesâ€”from running tests in continuous integration (CI) environments to debugging specific test cases in development.

- [**`robot.toml` Configuration File**](config.md): The `robot.toml` file serves as a centralized configuration for managing settings in Robot Framework projects in a structured, maintainable way. This section provides a complete guide to the available settings in `robot.toml`, including instructions on creating profiles for different environments, extending or inheriting settings, and managing variables, libraries, and dependencies across testing scenarios. With `robot.toml`, teams can efficiently handle project configurations, reduce redundancy, and simplify the setup of complex test environments.

Together, these sections provide the knowledge needed to fully customize `robotcode` for a flexible and efficient testing workflow.
